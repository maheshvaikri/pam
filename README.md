Process Activity  Monitor (PAM)
===============================

PAM logs how much time you spend doing certain tasks on your computer daily, by monitoring when applications, defined in the settings, start and finish executing. These values are stored in a CSV file.  

A group of applications used to perform a task is known as an 'activity' in PAM.
For example, a 'Design' activity could contain 'illustrator.exe' and 'photoshop.exe' and 'Programming' would contain your text editors and IDEs.

The data collected can be used for your own data visualization purposes.

## Requirements

* Windows 7, 8 or 10
* .NET 4.5

## Installation

* [Download the binaries](https://github.com/stillwwater/pam/releases) or compile from source (run build.cmd)
* Unpack the compressed archive
* Run `pam.exe` (the setup tool will start automatically if PAM is not configured)

## Running PAM in the Background

PAM is designed to run in the background for most of its uptime. When clicking `Hide` in the titlebar, the GUI is closed and a background process, containing only the core features of PAM, is launched. This allows for minimal memory usage when running PAM in the background. The GUI can still be accessed via an icon in the system tray.

If starting the background process directly without opening the GUI is preferred, set `StartInBackground` to `true` in `settings.json`.

## Scripting

PAM can execute scripts and display their output, this can be used to plot the data generated by PAM. A R script is included in the download to demonstrate how this can be done, however any tools that can be passed a script to be executed, as a parameter, will work.

In order for this feature to work, the path to the interpreter that will be executing the code must be defined in the settings, and the file or files must be in the 'Scripts' directory. The interpreter will be executed from the location containing `pam.exe`, therefore `./Data/pam_data.csv` can be used to reference the CSV file and the plot generated by the script must be saved to `./Plots` with the same filename as the script (minus the file extension), in order for it to show up in the GUI.
